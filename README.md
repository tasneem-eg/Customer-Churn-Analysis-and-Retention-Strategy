# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Retention-Strategy
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to identify patterns that lead to churn (when customers stop using a service). By leveraging historical transaction and interaction data, the project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn risk and provide insights for retention strategies.
